# AI-Powered Resume Screening System

This repository contains the research and deliverables for a computing research module focused on designing an AI-powered resume screening system using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.

## 📌 Project Overview

Manual resume screening is time-consuming and prone to bias. This project proposes a scalable, ethical solution using AI to analyze and rank resumes automatically. The system supports HR teams in shortlisting candidates more effectively and fairly.

## 🎯 Aim & Objectives

**Aim:**  
To design an AI-based resume screening system using NLP and ML to automate and enhance the hiring process.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the limitations of traditional resume screening
- Conduct a comprehensive literature review
- Design a prototype screening pipeline
- Use NLP to extract key resume details
- Apply machine learning for classification and ranking
- Analyze ethical, legal, and social implications

## 🧠 Research Questions

- How can NLP and ML improve the efficiency of resume screening?
- What ethical concerns arise from automated hiring tools?
- How can AI reduce or perpetuate hiring bias?
